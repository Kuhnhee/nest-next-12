# Nest.js - Next.js integration project
Practice repository based on [this article](https://dev.to/yakovlev_alexey/creating-a-project-with-nestjs-nextjs-3i1i)
The article assumes using Next.js version 11. So if your are using version 12, just simply following the code will not work properly.

## run
runs nest server & next render server at same time
```
yarn start:dev
```

Confirm page is running at http://localhost:3000
